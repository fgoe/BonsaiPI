# BonsaiPi
Stuff to measure VWC on my bonsai tree and automatically rinse it.

Hardware:
- Raspberry Pi 2
- Custard Pi 2 Addon
- Vegetronix VH-400 sensor
- TS912 Opamp as impedance converter for the moisture sensor
- 1x Relais for switching the pump
- Some perfboard and wires

Includes python scripts for reading values from a vegetronix VH-400 sensor and triggering the water pump.
Additional scripts for creating a rrd database and giving some web output coming soon.
